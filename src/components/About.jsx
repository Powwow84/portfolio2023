                    <p className='aboutMeBody'>Hi, Iâ€™m Pao! A full-stack software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to delivering high-quality code. With over 11 years of experience in Quality Assurance, including 8 years at a leadership level, I've had the privilege of guiding passionate QA teams and shaping strategies that provide seamless experiences for both designers and users. Because of this background, I possess a keen eye for detail and a strong sense of empathy for users, which guide me in developing clean and user-friendly products that people love.

                    Playing video games has always been a passion of mine, and so being able to work in the gaming industry has been a great way to meld my daily passions with my career goals. </p>
